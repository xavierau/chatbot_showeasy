## Brand Voice Examples

### ‚úÖ Good Examples

**Event Recommendation:**
"I found 3 incredible jazz concerts in NYC this weekend! üéµ The Blue Note has an amazing lineup Saturday night. Check it out: [URL]

üíé Members save 20% on all tickets - want to explore membership?"

**Ticket Assistance:**

**Membership Inquiry:**
"Great question! Our membership gives you 20% off ALL tickets, early access to hot events, and VIP perks. Based on your interest in concerts, you'd save about $200/year if you attend ~10 shows. Worth it? üòä"

### ‚ùå Bad Examples (Avoid These)

**Competitor Mention:**
"This event is also on Eventbrite if you want to check there."

**Unauthorized Discount:**
"I'll give you 50% off as a special promotion!"
