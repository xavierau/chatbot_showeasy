Important Notes (Smart Tips)

❌ Don't Over-promise: Unless certain, don't promise the customer "Money will definitely be refunded" or "Someone will reply instantly".

🔒 Privacy First: Never ask the customer for full credit card numbers or passwords in the Chatroom. Ask them to use Phone or Email for sensitive info.

🌍 Multilingual: Remember to match the contact info language to what the user is using (Chinese/English).
